# Gym-app
- You will have to firstly have a postgres database, I added the code to create the database
- Log in or make a new account in this app to use it. 
- Users that enter in their account can request a trainer, ask for training advice from their selected trainer or buy supplements. 
- With a future update, an algorithm that selects custom training based on different parameters will provide the user the optimal training routine
